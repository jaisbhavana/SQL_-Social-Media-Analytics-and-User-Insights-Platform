**Task 1: Create ER Diagram or Schema** <br>
Description: In this task, you will design and create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram or a structured schema for the database. The diagram or schema should clearly define the database's tables, relationships between them, and the attributes each table contains. This visual representation is essential for understanding the database structure and its organization.<br>

**Task 2: Find the 5 Oldest Users**<br>
Description: To identify the five oldest users on the platform, you will query the database to retrieve user registration dates. Then, you'll sort these dates in ascending order and select the top five, indicating the users who have been registered on the platform for the longest duration.

**Task 3: Determine the Busiest Registration Day**
Description: To determine the day of the week when most users register on the platform, you will analyze the registration date data. By counting the number of registrations for each day of the week and finding the highest count, you can pinpoint the most popular registration day. This information is valuable for scheduling ad campaigns when user engagement is likely to be higher.<br>

**Task 4: Target Inactive Users for an Email Campaign**<br>
Description: This task involves identifying users who have never posted a photo on the platform. To accomplish this, you will query the database to retrieve user activity data and pinpoint users who haven't contributed any photos. This information can be used to target inactive users in an email ad campaign, encouraging them to engage more with the platform.

**Task 5: Find the User with the Most Likes on a Photo** <br>
Description: To determine the user who received the highest number of likes on a photo, you will query the database to gather data on photo likes. Then, you will identify the user whose photo garnered the most likes. This information is useful for contest-related purposes or recognizing popular users.<br>

**Task 6: Calculate the Average User Post Frequency** <br>
Description: In this task, you will calculate the average number of posts made by users on the platform. You will query the database to retrieve user post data and calculate the average number of posts per user. This metric provides insights into user engagement and posting behavior.

**Task 7: Determine the Top 5 Most Used Hashtags** <br>
Description: To find the top five most frequently used hashtags on the platform, you will query the database to analyze hashtag usage across posts. By counting the occurrences of each hashtag and selecting the top five, you can identify the most popular hashtags. This information helps a brand decide which hashtag to use for a post or campaign.

**Task 8: Identify Potential Bots** <br>
Description: This task involves identifying users who have liked every single photo on the platform. By querying the database for user activity, you can pinpoint users with this specific behavior. Identifying such users can help detect potential bot accounts or irregular user activity.

**Task 9: Find Celebrity Users** <br>
Description: To identify celebrity users on the platform, you will query the database to find users who have never commented on a photo. Celebrity users may not frequently engage with comments, so this task helps pinpoint them based on their distinct engagement patterns.

**Task 10: Identify Unique User Behavior** <br>
Description: In this task, you will find users who have exhibited unique engagement behavior. This includes users who have either never commented on any photo or have commented on every photo. Identifying such users can provide insights into diverse user behavior patterns on the platform.

**These tasks require data querying and analysis skills, as well as the ability to draw insights from the database to inform various aspects of the platform, including user engagement, marketing campaigns, and content strategy.**
